"""This file contains a collection of standard key derivation functions.

A key derivation function derives one or more secondary secret keys from
one primary secret (a master key or a pass phrase).

This is typically done to insulate the secondary keys from each other,
to avoid that leakage of a secondary key compromises the security of the
master key, or to thwart attacks on pass phrases (e.g. via rainbow tables).
