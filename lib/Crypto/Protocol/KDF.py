"""This file contains a collection of standard key derivation functions.

A key derivation function derives one or more secondary secret keys from
one primary secret (a master key or a pass phrase).

This is typically done to insulate the secondary keys from each other,
to avoid that leakage of a secondary key compromises the security of the
master key, or to thwart attacks on pass phrases (e.g. via rainbow tables).

    """Derive one key from a password (or passphrase).

    This function performs key derivation according an old version of
    the PKCS#5 standard (v1.5).
    
    This algorithm is called ``PBKDF1``. Even though it is still described
    in the latest version of the PKCS#5 standard (version 2, or RFC2898),
    newer applications should use the more secure and versatile `PBKDF2` instead.

    :Parameters:
     password : string
        The secret password or pass phrase to generate the key from.
     salt : byte string
        An 8 byte string to use for better protection from dictionary attacks.
        This value does not need to be kept secret, but it should be randomly
        chosen for each derivation.
     dkLen : integer
        The length of the desired key. Default is 16 bytes, suitable for instance for `Crypto.Cipher.AES`.
     count : integer
        The number of iterations to carry out. It's recommended to use at least 1000.
     hashAlgo : module
        The hash algorithm to use, as a module or an object from the `Crypto.Hash` package.
        The digest length must be no shorter than ``dkLen``.

    :Return: A byte string of length `dkLen` that can be used as key.
