"""MD5 cryptographic hash algorithm.

MD5 is specified in RFC1321_ and produces the 128 bit digest of a message.

    >>> from Crypto.Hash import MD5
    >>>
    >>> h = MD5.new()
    >>> h.update(b'Hello')
    >>> print h.hexdigest()

MD4 stand for Message Digest version 5, and it was invented by Rivest in 1991.

This algorithm is insecure. Do not use it for new designs.
