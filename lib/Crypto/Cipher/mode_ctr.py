    """*CounTeR (CTR)* mode.

    This mode is very similar to ECB, in that
    encryption of one block is done independently of all other blocks.

    Unlike ECB, the block *position* contributes to the encryption
    and no information leaks about symbol frequency.

    Each message block is associated to a *counter* which
    must be unique across all messages that get encrypted
    with the same key (not just within the same message).
    The counter is as big as the block size.

    Counters can be generated in several ways. The most
    straightword one is to choose an *initial counter block*
    (which can be made public, similarly to the *IV* for the
    other modes) and increment its lowest **m** bits by one
    (modulo *2^m*) for each block. In most cases, **m** is
    chosen to be half the block size.

    See `NIST SP800-38A`_ , Section 6.5 (for the mode) and
    Appendix B (for how to manage the *initial counter block*).

            It shall contain a nonce or a random component.
