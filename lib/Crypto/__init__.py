"""Python Cryptography Toolkit

A collection of cryptographic modules implementing various algorithms
and protocols.

Subpackages:

Crypto.Cipher
 Secret-key (AES, DES, ARC4) and public-key encryption (RSA PKCS#1) algorithms
Crypto.Hash
 Hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA, HMAC)
Crypto.Protocol
 Cryptographic protocols (Chaffing, all-or-nothing transform, key derivation
 functions). This package does not contain any network protocols.
Crypto.PublicKey
 Public-key encryption and signature algorithms (RSA, DSA)
Crypto.Signature
 Public-key signature algorithms (RSA PKCS#1) 
Crypto.Util
 Various useful modules and functions (long-to-string conversion, random number
 generation, number theoretic functions)
